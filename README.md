# MVP_Cesar_Desk

This is the front-end solution designed by my group during an educational training program by Porto Digital in collaboration with the Federal Institute of Pernambuco and
Cesar company. The aim was to build the front-end webpage in which Cesar employees would be able to book specific working stations, laboratories or equipments in order to
work in person when the sanitary restrictions were more flexible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The solution was built by constant conversations with the client to deliver exactly what was required.
